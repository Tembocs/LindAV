# Lindav Security

Lindav is a Flutter demo app inspired by tools like Smadav.
It shows a simple security dashboard UI with:

- A status card that shows whether a scan is running and the last result.
- Buttons for **Quick Scan**, **Full Scan**, and **USB Scan**.
- A scan history list with time, files scanned, and threats found.

The current implementation simulates scans only (no real antivirus engine).

## Run the app

From the project root:

```pwsh
flutter run
```

## Run tests

```pwsh
flutter test
```

You can use this project as a starting point to plug in
real scanning logic (native code, external services, etc.).
